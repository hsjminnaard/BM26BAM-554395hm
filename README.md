This code has been created for the course BM26BAM FinTech: Business Models and Application at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam. 

*EnviroBond Exchange*

This code is a minimum viable product called EnviroBond Exchange, which is a trading platform exclusively for green bonds. 
EnviroBond Exchange will address the shortcomings of the current green bonds market and will maximise transparency and accessibility. 

To make the platform as transparent as possible EnviroBond Exchange will be a blockchain technology driven platform. 
"Blockchain technology is an advanced database mechanism that allows transparent information sharing within a business network" (AWS, n.d.). 
This technology ensures P2P (peer to peer) trading at lower expense and at higher speeds (Daley \& Velazquez, 2024). 
Blockchain trading means transparent pricing, faster payment processing and immutable transaction record keeping. 

*How to use this code?*

This code was written in vscode editor using the extension Solidity. 
Additionally, to be able to run the code, Ganache is used to function as the platformâ€™s blockchain (https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/). 

EnviroBond Exchange will use smart contracts to include conditions and requirements for its issuers of bonds as suggested by Doran and Tanner (2019). 
Three smart contracts have been created, each with its own code to deploy the contract on the blockchain. 
The contracts and corresponding deploy files are called:
BondIssuanceContract.sol and DeployBIC.py 
MicroInvestingContract.sol and DeployMIC.py 
SubscriptionContract.sol and DeploySC.py 

MicroInvestingContract_vis.sol and DeployMIC_vis.py were solely used for the demonstration and will not be included on the platform itself.
